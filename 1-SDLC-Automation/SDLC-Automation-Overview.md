### Objective 1: SDLC Automation (22%)
#### Goal
Automate and manage the software development lifecycle (SDLC) using AWS services.

#### Key Areas
1. **Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)**:
   - **CI**: Automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.
   - **CD**: Automating the delivery of applications to selected infrastructure environments.

2. **AWS Services for CI/CD**:
   - **AWS CodeCommit**: A source control service that hosts Git-based repositories.
   - **AWS CodeBuild**: A service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages.
   - **AWS CodeDeploy**: Automates application deployments to various AWS services.
   - **AWS CodePipeline**: A continuous delivery service that automates the release process for a software application.

3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
   - Using AWS CloudFormation or similar services to manage and provision AWS resources programmatically.

4. **Microservices and Containerization**:
   - Understanding the deployment and management of microservices architecture.
   - Using services like AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) and EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for container orchestration.

5. **Deployment Strategies**:
   - Familiarity with various deployment models (e.g., blue/green, canary, rolling updates).
   - Implementing these strategies using AWS services to ensure minimal downtime and smooth rollouts.

6. **Version Control and Source Code Management**:
   - Best practices in version control.
   - Leveraging AWS CodeCommit or integration with other version control systems like GitHub.

7. **Automated Testing**:
   - Implementing automated testing within the CI/CD pipeline.
   - Integration of testing frameworks and tools in the AWS environment.

8. **Monitoring and Logging of CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Using tools like AWS CloudWatch to monitor the performance and health of CI/CD pipelines.
   - Implementing logging for tracking and auditing changes in the deployment process.

#### Skills and Best Practices
- Deep understanding of DevOps principles and practices as they relate to the AWS ecosystem.
- Proficiency in scripting and automation tools.
- Knowledge of best practices for secure and efficient CI/CD pipelines.
- Ability to implement end-to-end automation from code check-in to deployment in production environments.

#### Practical Application
- Creating and managing a complete CI/CD pipeline using AWS services.
- Automating the build, test, and deployment phases of the SDLC.
- Implementing IaC for consistent and repeatable deployment of AWS resources.
- Integrating security and compliance checks into the CI/CD process.

### Study Focus
Given the weight of this objective (22%), a significant portion of your preparation should be focused on mastering AWS services related to CI/CD, understanding automation in the context of the SDLC, and applying these in practical, real-world scenarios. This involves not only theoretical knowledge but also hands-on practice with AWS services to solidify your understanding of SDLC automation.
